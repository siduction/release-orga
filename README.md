<h4>General Planning</h4>

<b>Release schedule</b>
* How many more releases do we want to / can we do in 2023?
* Do we want to release one before Plasma 6 arrives?
* If we want to integrate Timeshift, maybe it's a good idea to do that somewhwn before the one for Plasma 6.


<b>New features:</b>
* Add Timeshift to package list
* set it up to do a first image right after install
