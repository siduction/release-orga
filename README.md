# Planning our next release

Feel free to chime in, add issues and proposals!

## Planning for siduction 2025.1

### General Planning

**Release schedule**
* How many more releases do we want to / can we do in 2025?
  * A snapshot every two months at testbuilds.siduction.org
* If we want to integrate Timeshift, maybe it's a good idea to do it now.

**New features:**
* Add Timeshift to package list
  * set it up to do a first image right after install

**Enhancement:**
* The configuration of XFCE requires our attention.
  * The switch to Weyland may make work easier.
* APT signatures
